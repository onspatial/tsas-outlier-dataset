# tsas-outlier-dataset
I am using this repository to extend the outlier dataset by incorporating patterns of life simulation. In my previous paper, I used github.com/onspatial/pol-outlier-dataset. In this work, I am enhancing the simulation with additional features to generate a new dataset for the extended version submitted to TSAS.
